# The-Game-of-Hog
In this project, my objective was to create a comprehensive simulator for the dice game Hog. To achieve this, I leveraged control statements and higher-order functions. Additionally, I implemented multiple strategies to enhance the gameplay experience and explore different approaches to winning the game. By combining these elements, I created a versatile and engaging simulation environment.
