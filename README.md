# The-Game-of-Hog
In this project, I created a dynamic and immersive simulator for the dice game Hog. Leveraging control statements and higher-order functions, I developed a comprehensive gameplay experience that encompasses multiple strategies for winning the game.

The simulator provides players with a dynamic environment to explore various approaches to success. By implementing diverse strategies, I aimed to enhance the gameplay experience and challenge players to refine their skills and tactics.

With meticulous attention to detail, I ensured the simulator faithfully adhered to the game's mechanics and rules. By combining control statements and higher-order functions, I crafted an immersive and authentic simulation that captures the essence of the Hog dice game.

Through this project, I have demonstrated my proficiency in programming concepts and my ability to create interactive and enjoyable simulations.
